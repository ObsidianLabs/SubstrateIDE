# Substrate IDE

![](./docs/img/main.png)

Substrate IDE can help developers quickly build [Substrate](https://substrate.dev/)-based blockchains. It provides tools required for both blockchain and frontend development. The integrated [polkadot.js explorer](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps) and [polkadot{.js} extension](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension) make interaction with Substrate nodes very easy.

You can go to [releases](https://github.com/ObsidianLabs/SubstrateIDE/releases) to download installation packages.
